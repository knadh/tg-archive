**tg-archive** is a tool for exporting Telegram group chats into static websites, preserving chat history like mailing list archives.

## How it works
tg-archive uses the [Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon) Telegram API client to periodically sync messages from a group to a local SQLite database (file), downloading only new messages since the last sync. It then generates a static archive website of messages to be published anywhere.

## Features
- Periodically sync Telegram group messages to a local DB.
- Download user avatars locally.
- Download and embed media (files, documents, photos).
- Renders poll results.
- Use emoji alternatives in place of stickers.
- Single file Jinja HTML template for generating the static site.
- Year / Month / Day indexes with deep linking across pages.
- "In reply to" on replies with links to parent messages across pages.
- RSS / Atom feed of recent messages.

## Install
- Get [Telegram API credentials](https://my.telegram.org/auth?to=apps). Normal user account API and not the Bot API.
- Install with `pip3 install tg-archive` (tested with Python 3.8.6).

You can install the latest unstable version with

```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/knadh/tg-archive
```

### Usage

1. `tg-archive --new --path=mysite` (creates a new site. `cd` into mysite and edit `config.yaml`).
1. `tg-archive --sync` (syncs data into `data.sqlite`).
  Note: First time connection will prompt for your phone number + a Telegram auth code sent to the app. On successful auth, a `session.session` file is created. DO NOT SHARE this session file publicly as it contains the API autorization for your account.
1. `tg-archive --build` (builds the static site into the `site` directory, which can be published)

### Customization
Edit the generated `template.html` and static assets in the `./static` directory to customize the site.

### Note
- The sync can be stopped (Ctrl+C) any time to be resumed later.
- Setup a cron job to periodically sync messages and re-publish the archive.
- Downloading large media files and long message history from large groups continuously may run into Telegram API's rate limits. Watch the debug output.
